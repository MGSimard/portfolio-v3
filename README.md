## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LQ2s3qQ.jpeg)

Rebuilt my old vanilla portfolio from the ground-up in React. Bunch of performance, design and accessibility improvements across the board. Usage of mix-blend-mode for H1 titles has some negative impact due to a choice of style over necessity, but I alleviated as much of it as possible by forcing GPU rendering with a translateZ(0) on said elements.

If for some reason someone wants to use this portfolio as their own, project gallery data is in each of the json files in src\\\_data. As for gamedev pages, they're static pages rather than dynamically generated, so you won't find that in the data files.
